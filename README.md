# Question 1

Subject: Feedback on Qikify

Hello Jeremy,

I appreciate your email and all the comments you have made.

Once again I deeply apologize if you found the application in any manner confusing. I absolutely understand the frustration that accompanies when things do not go as planned. We do strive to improve the experience with the app, and your feedback is indeed helpful.

In relation to the refund you have requested, regrettably, per our app policy we are not able to refund once the 7 days of the free trial has elapsed. As you have pointed out, the trial period was fully consumed, and the app subsequently moved onto the paid plan automatically.

Notwithstanding, if you change your mind, we would want to assist you. We can walk you through the setup process step by step, or address any of your concerns in order for things to be more convenient for you.

Please advise how you wish to proceed. Once more, I thank you for using Qikify.

Sincerely,

Dang Cong Truong

The Qikify Support Team
